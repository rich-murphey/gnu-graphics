Mon Mar 11 11:08:40 1991  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* plot.c: use getopt. Version 0.4

Sun Feb 10 18:26:07 1991  Rich Murphey  (murphey at cns16)

	* drawline.c, alabel.c, circle.c, added code to center
	the plot vertically on the page.

Sat Feb  9 21:51:12 1991  Rich Murphey  (murphey at cns15)

	* libplot.h: Changed value of SCALING to 1 for compatibility
	with idraw version 7.  Changed max x and y_output_max values
	in drawline.c accordingly.

Thu Oct 18 11:09:32 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* plot.c: fixed bug in arguments to erase. This is version 0.3.

Wed Oct 17 22:30:42 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* plot.c: -help and -V report the version number. This is 0.1.

Sun Oct 14 15:35:54 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* plot2ps.man: added description of atend.pl and -bbox
	* open.c close.c plot3.h: #define SCALING to be the scale
	  factor in the postscript CTM now that it is used widely
	  in bounding box computation.

Fri Oct 12 13:02:30 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* header.c: squezed the idraw version 7 prolog down to 100 lines
	  using Tom Rokicki's squeze program (see divps).  Sun's compiler
	  can handle the length of the string much easier in this form.

Mon Sep 10 09:51:18 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at unicorn)

	* range.c: added code to determine the max and min coordinates.
	* plot.c: added -bbox option. -bbox specifies that a eps bounding
          box comment is to be written at the end of the file, in the trailer.
	* open.c, close.c: added code to write the bounding box.
	* plot2ps.texinfo: added description of -bbox and atend.pl.

Tue May 15 15:05:52 1990  Rich Murphey  (rich at kalliope)

	* open.c: added a space after %! in `%!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF-1.2'.
	  Some printers (LW IINT, QMSPS810) need it.

	* plot2ps.tex: compare output files sizes of plot2ps and
	  other converters. We could cull out unused code from the
 	  prolog. Thanks synchrods!daniel@cad.berkeley.edu.

Thu Nov  9 11:01:35 1989  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* plot2ps.tex: removed mentions of un*x in the documentation.

	* plot.c: added the `-line-width' option. The argument is the
	  integer valued width of lines drawn in the plot.  Values of
	  0 were causing problems for idraw. Added a note about this
	  to the documentation for `-line-width'.

Sun Sep 10 18:55:43 1989  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* removed postscript hardcopy documentation and texinfo.tex
	from the distributed sources to reduce the size.  The hardcopy
	is now a seperately distributed file.

	* added testdist target to makefile.
