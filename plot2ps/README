This is the README file for plot2ps, a utility for converting unix
plot files to postscript.  See plot2ps.texinfo, the manual, for a more
complete description of plot2ps.

The makefile has instructions for installing plot2ps.  For many
machines you can just type `make' and should expect the message `The
regression test of plot2ps PASSED.' at the end of the compillation.

Many thanks to Richard Stallman for his helpful discussions of the
program and editing the documentation.  Also, thanks to John
Interrante for generously providing the postscript prologue and
helpful comments on the program.

Any comments or suggestions on improvements to plot2ps are welcome.
