	* Imakefile: Richard Roy <dick@isl.stanford.edu>
	adds alabel.o to OBJ and alable.c to SRC.

Mon Mar 11 11:05:05 1991  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* xplot.c: use getopt. added +catch-sighup and
	+dont-fork options.  This required moving the `signal()'
	to follow the option parsing.  Are there cases where
	the signal needs to be ignored sooner? Version 0.4

Sun Mar  3 15:09:49 1991  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* alabel.c: load the default font if a named font does not
	exist in the server. This is version 0.3

Sat Nov 10 10:44:59 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* xplot.c: added program name to error message.

Wed Oct 17 22:02:32 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* xplot.c: fixed font resource bug in fallback_resources.
	Thanks to David W. Forslund <dwf%hope.ACL@lanl.gov> for catching it!
	* xplot.c, Makefile: added -v option which reports the version
	number. This is version 0.2.

	* rewrote the X initialization code in openpl again in order to
	  avoid the bug in the Sun4 SunOS 4.1 kernel.  This time we
	  are reading the whole plot file into a buffer befor opening
	  any windows.  That seems to help.  It still needs to handle
	  resize events.

* added file alabel.c containing plot functions for extended plot file
  format.

* changed label so that it calls alabel.

* added extensions to the main loop which reads in the plot file.

* added the `-debug' option.  The output is similar to the output
  of plottoa. So, except for the extensions we should be able to
  filter the output with /usr/bin/atoplot and then other plot filters
  to make debugging easier.

rich@rice.edu 8/13/90

* rewrote much of the X initialization code in openpl in order to
  avoid what seems to be a bug in the Sun4 SunOS 4.1 kernel.  If xplot
  crashes the OS with `bad trap' and `data fault' messages, you have been
  bit by this bug.

* changed from a label widget to a command widget.  This makes naturally makes
  the left button `QUIT' -- exit and close the window.

* keep all of the input read from stdin in a buffer.  Later on we can
  add a resize method which redraws the window using this data.

* Use XClearWindow after reaching the end each pipe full of data and after 
  the pipe is closed to force the display to expose all newly drawn lines and
  text in the pixmap.

* fork() after the end of file is reached, so that the parent process
  can continue while the window stays on the screen.
