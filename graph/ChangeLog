	* graph.c: rewrote loop termination test for labeling the
	axes.  It failed on NeXT.

Tue Mar 26 11:33:56 1991  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* graph.c: Let the option `-a 0' diable automatic generation of
	the abscissa.  That is, after `-a 0', abscissal values are read
	from the following data files.  This also resets the default
	sampling interval and starting x value to 1 and 0, respectively.

	* graph.c: missing break between parsing -l and -N
	options is added.

Thu Mar  7 16:02:18 1991  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* graph.c, read_file.c: added -c option.  `-c string' defines
	string as the default label for each point.
	
	* graph.c, read_file.c: added -t option which transposes the axes.
	After specifying -t, options applying the the x and y axes are
	reversed.  Thus -x, -X and -lx apply to the y axis when -t is specified.

	* these are all the options documented for other versions of
	graph.  So, we ought to be able to claim some compatibility.
		
Tue Mar  5 14:52:30 1991  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* graph.c: warn the user if one of the margins is too narrow for a
	label. Version 0.15

Sun Feb 10 17:04:14 1991  Rich Murphey  (murphey at cns16)

	* write_plot.c: commented out rotatation of Y axis label.
	Bug in y_label position fixed.

Sat Feb  9 15:01:20 1991  Rich Murphey  (murphey at cns15)

	* graph.c, extern.h, write_plot.c: rounding the limits
	of the axes is now the default.  Added code for `-N[x|y]' which
	omits labels from the tick marks.

Sun Dec  2 22:16:28 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* write_plot.c: added more graphical symbols (box, diamond, etc).

Wed Nov 14 00:51:56 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at taj)

	* graph.c: added -R option to specify that the limits of the
	x and y axes should be rounded (extended) to the next tick mark.
	This is version 0.14.

	* write_plot.c: fixed bug in code for margin option. margin
	extends log axes by a power of the ratio of the limits.  Aack.

	* graph.c: report an error if integer options don't begin with a digit.
	This is version 13.

	* write_plot.c: take ceiling of before converting to int for lower
	limit on each axis.
	Also, relaxed the restrictions on the limits: min and max limits
	for the axes can be reversed.

Sat Nov 10 11:22:30 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* write_plot.c: throw away points which fall outsice the limits of
	the plot and break lines when this occurrs.
	Omit code for rounding limits to nearest tick mark.  We should
	make this a non-default option.

Fri Nov  9 00:05:54 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* graph.c: fixed bug when +margin nonzero is specified.

Thu Nov  8 16:03:42 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* write_plot.c: added clipping in macros.  rewrote part
	of the code for determining values at tick marks to use
	integer artithmentic.  This will avoid compound round-off
	errors associated with floating point arithmetic.

	* graph.c, write_plot.c: moved break_flag, m_break_flag and
	linemode_index into the argument list for write_plot so that
	it can be used in other programs without depending on as much
	static data.

	* graph.c: arguements to -a, -x, -y, and -S are optional.  This
	looks a little easier to implement cleanly.  Added support for
	`-x l' and `-y l' which specify logarithmic x and y axes
	respectively.  This is version 0.11.

Wed Nov  7 14:45:56 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* write_plot.c:  According to the texinfo file, a grid spec of 0
	(no grid) should have no axes, ticks or labels.  It does that now.

	* graph.c:  Swapped meanings of -l and -L:  -l is for log axes,
	and -L is for the top label.  Changed option names of some long 
	options and their values to better names and more intuitive values.

Wed Nov  7 11:12:53 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* max.c: return a range of (-1, 1) for zero lentgh arrays.
	This is consistent with the behavior of other versions of graph.

Tue Nov  6 20:12:37 1990  Ray Toy  (toy at dino.ecse.rpi.edu)

	* graph.c:  added -L/+log-axis to allow plotting data on log
	axes.  Either x, y, or both x and y axes may be log axes.
	* write_plot.c:  Added support for plotting on log axes.  Axis
	labels are also written.  Changed computation of max and min
	values so that the bounding box always has an axis label on it.
	Using +margin and log axes produces funny tick marks.

Thu Nov  1 23:52:41 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* read_file.c: fixed bug in reading binary float and double.

Wed Oct 31 22:18:59 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* read_file.c: fixed "%f " bug.  Read labels only for ascii input.
	* graph.c: added `-margin N' option to specify the margin between
	data and the edges of the box.  Fixed bug in `-a' where defaults
	were not set for missing arguments.

Tue Oct 30 22:46:01 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* graph.c: optimize move after symbols, and empty labels.
	* graph.c: replaced tick spacing algorithm with one contributed
	by Ray Toy <toy@dino.ecse.rpi.edu>.  Nice stuff Roy!!!
	* read_file.c: binary data input support also from Roy.

	* graph.c: Added code for -b, -M and -m options. This is
	version 0.6.  Thanks to Dave Rosen for catching these!

Sun Oct 28 17:43:16 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* This is version 0.5
	* Changes contributed by Ray Toy <toy@dino.ecse.rpi.edu>:

	* graph.c:  graph dumps core on bad options, So we
	added a macro IF_ARGOK(option) which makes sure
	we have not gone past the end of the arguemnts (argv) and
	prints an error message if so.  Graph should not core dump
	if a an argument to an option is omitted.

	* The texinfo file for graph seems to imply that -a may have
	0, 1, or 2 parameters following it.  I've fixed it so this
	is true.  If no parameters are given, the defaults are used.

	* All error messages (hopefully!) now include the program name
	in the message so you can find out who printed the message.
	Useful when graph is used inside of complex scripts and pipes.

	* Not all compilers that recognize void recognize void *.  So,
	#define VOIDPTR if your compiler recognizes void *.  If it
	doesn't, char * is used instead.

	* Added some support if you have ANSI compliant .h files.  Use
	STDC_HEADERS to get this.

	* extern.h read_file.c: pass the address of the pointer to
	point_struct so that when the array of points is realloced,
	read_file can the pointer to it's new location.
	Also, the test to determine if the array should be enlarged
	has been moved to the beginning of the while loop.


Fri Oct 19 01:14:40 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* graph.c: added the xyXYTwhur and l options.
	* graph.texinfo: documented them and cleaned up.
	This is version 0.4.

Thu Oct 18 11:15:09 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* *.c *.h: chaged (void*) to (char*) to avoid complaints
	  from the ultrix C compiler. This is version 0.3.

Wed Oct 17 22:28:10 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* graph.c: -help and -V report the version number. This is 0.1.
