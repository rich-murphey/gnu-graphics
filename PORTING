If your machine type is not specified in the Makefile, there are
several files you may need to edit in order to install GNU graphics.

Makefile: You will need to edit the Makefile to define a target for
your machine type.

include/sys-defines.h: Each source file which needs system include
files such as stdio.h, ctype.h, math.h, and string.h include the file
include/sys-defines.h.  You can edit the file include/sys-defines.h in
order to specify the proper system include files for most the source
files here.

xplot/Makefile: You may have to modify the makefile to specify the
location of the X include files and libraries if they are not in
/usr/include/X11 and /usr/lib/X11.
