	* graphics.texinfo: added a note about using `which graph' to
	check whether /bin/graph is being mistakenly used.  Removed
	references to `unix' where unnecessary.

Fri Mar 15 15:12:11 1991  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* graphics.texinfo: Tektronix was spelled improperly.

Tue Mar 12 01:30:15 1991  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* regresstion tests on sun3, sun4 and sequent pass. This si
	version 0.16. double 0.13 graph 0.15 plot2fig 0.4 plot2plot 0.1
	plot2ps 0.4 plot2tek 0.3 tek2plot 0.1 xplot 0.4

Tue Mar  5 14:58:25 1991  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* graphics.texinfo: added more examples for graph.
	graph.c: added warning if margins are to small for labels.
	version 0.15: double 0.13 graph 0.15 plot2fig 0.3 plot2plot 0.1
	plot2ps 0.3 plot2tek 0.2 tek2plot 0.1 xplot 0.3

Sun Mar  3 12:22:42 1991  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* added byte ordering code to allow for a default host dependent
	byte ordering.  This should be more compatible with byte ordering
	of plot files in other versions of the plot utilities. This is
	version 0.14:
	double 0.13 graph 0.14 plot2fig 0.3 plot2plot 0.1 plot2ps 0.3
	plot2tek 0.2 tek2plot 0.1 xplot 0.3

	* We were announced on comp.archives today, so this is a good
	time to clean up and release: version 0.13:
	double 0.13 graph 0.14 plot2fig 0.3 plot2plot 0.1 plot2ps 0.3
	plot2tek 0.2 tek2plot 0.1 xplot 0.2

Sat Feb  9 15:01:20 1991  Rich Murphey  (murphey at cns15)

	* graphics.texinfo: added description of -N and -R options.

Thu Nov  8 00:09:57 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* cleaned up regression tests and makefiles. Version 0.10

Wed Nov  7 11:31:05 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at kappa)

	* graphics.texinfo: added Ray's description of long option names.
	* graph: more fixes to arguement parsing. This is version 0.9.

	* merged Ray's fixes for plto2tek, plot2plot, and graph as well
	as lots of new code.  This is version 0.8.

Tue Nov  6 13:52:06 1990  Ray Toy  (toy at dino.ecse.rpi.edu)

	* Added support for log axes in graph.c and write_plot.c.
	Doesn't quite work when margin != 0, though.  Added some
	info about it in graph.texinfo.

	* plot2plot modified to use GNU getopt.

Wed Oct 31 23:24:09 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* wrote plot2plot which reads and writes plot files in both
	ascii and binary formats and provides backward compatibility.
	* Seperated the copying message out of each program and had
	each include it from the COPYING file. This is version 0.7.
	* graphics.texinfo: condensed documentation into one file.

Mon Oct 29 13:44:49 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* added changes contributed by Ray Toy <toy@dino.ecse.rpi.edu>
	to graph.  This is version 0.5

Thu Oct 18 11:02:18 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* added prototypes to all library routine declarations and
