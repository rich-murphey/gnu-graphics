	* plot.c: use the copy in ../plot2tek.  This uses getopt now.
	This is version 0.4.

Tue Nov 20 11:43:14 1990  Richard Murphey  (rich at tahomah)

	* arc.c: revised for transfig 2.1 compatibility.  You have to
	specify nonzero line thickness for a line to be visible.
	this is version 0.3

	* cont.c, alabel.c: revised for transfig 2.0 compatibility.

	* space.c: David Dalton (dalton@geop.ubc.ca) suggested centering the
	  plot in the fig window.

	* linemod.c: added dot-dashed, short-dashed, and long-dashed as
	  aliases.  Solid lines are used when unrecognized line modes
	  are requested. Thanks David Dalton (dalton@geop.ubc.ca)!

	* Thanks to Micah Beck for helpful discussions and suggestions!

	* alabel.c: The function alabel ignores leading white space and
	  only outputs labels which contain non-white space characters.
	  This is compatible with the behavior of pic2fig which also
	  remove leading white space and ignores empty text.

	* space.c: The range of coordinates on the output is reduced to
	  (0-480) to allow the graphics to fit in a 6 inch square.  This
	  will avoid surprises for the user when latex is unable to fit
	  larger graphics within the margins.
